# LunarFalloutPlus
Wabbajack Modlist for Fallout 4, for a moderate difficulty survival playthrough.

Key Mods - Lunar Fallout Plus, Sim Settlements 2, Unique Creatures and Monsters, plus clothing and armor mods, improved location, and plenty of immersion.

Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
1) If you want, you can move the texture repacks into your game data folder, replacing the vanilla ones. It will reduce the space required by around 10 gigs, but isn't necessary for performance.
2) Backpacks of the Commonwealth - Select your chosen distribution when it comes up. I like backpacks being completely unique, but whatever you want.
3) Companion heal thyself - I recommend setting the stun to 95%, the reduced stimpack distribution makes it difficult to keep a companion up.
4) Utility Belt- equip the utility belt.
