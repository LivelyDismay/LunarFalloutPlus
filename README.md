# LunarFalloutPlus
Wabbajack Modlist for Fallout 4, for a moderate difficulty survival playthrough based on Lunar Fallout Overhaul, with a ton of extra spice.
Requires wabbajack - https://www.wabbajack.org/#/

Key Mods To Be Aware Of - Lunar Fallout Plus, Start Me Up, Sim Settlements 2, Lore Based Power Armor Changes, Auto Hack, Locky Bastard.
The Extra Spice: Tales from the Commonwealth, Gunmetal Weapon and Armor Skins, Boston Natural Surroundings, Unique NPCs Creatures and Monsters
Optional Creation Club Content Compatibility: Weapons and Armor Skins (Paint the Commonwealth, an optional mod that will distribute the skins in the world)

Things you should know...
1) The game is balanced for a Survival playthrough that feels more like Normal or hard.
2) The early levels are difficult until you get a bit of equipment, grab whatever armor you can as fast as you can (seriously, people are SHOOTING at you, your t-shirt ain't gonna protect you). Don't expect to be able to handle a pack of ferals until at least level 10.
3) The scaling of Lunar Fallout expects you to take either Gunslinger, Rifleman, or Big Leagues, I recommend picking a build style (Pistols, Rifles, or Melee), and taking the relevant perk when you're able.
4) Perks have increasing SPECIAL requirements, and specials can be trained past 10.
5) Raider power armor drains Fusion Cores slower than the T45 but doesn't protect you as much, and fusion cores are harder to find. Raider power armor can also be repaired without the Armorer perk, so it might seem like a downgrade but if you want to use power armor grabbing a set isn't a bad idea. Read the nexus page for LoreBasedPowerArmorChanges for more details.
6) Shoot locks open, read the nexus page for LockyBastard for more details.

Technical Notes
1) The modlist includes a full repack of the vanilla texture BSAs for better performance, based on PhyOP light and the BiRaitBiTec texture packs, if you want to save a little space you can replace the BSAs in your data folder with them.
2) The modlist is designed for reliatively modern, middle range hardware. A high end graphics card is not required, but a decent processor is a must for running heavily modded Fallout 4.

Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
1) Move the "Game Files Folder", found inside the MO2 folder, into your game directory, to complete installation of F4SE and ENB
2) HighFPSFix.ini - adjust vsync and FPS cap to your desired settings, based on your monitor framerate, and whether you need vsync (if you don't have a g-sync or free-sync compatible monitor and graphics card, you need v-sync)
3) Disable PaintTheCommonwealth if you do not have the required creation club skins, disable CC-FoundOnly.esp if you have the skins, and want to be able to craft them.
4) Pick your difficulty - choose one of the optional esps from the mod "Difficulty (Pick an optional)"

When making a new game, after initial character creation a number of installation messages will display. DO NOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL THESE HAVE FINISHED. The FO4 script engine is fragile, and needs a minute to run through all the startup. If you get a message from Sim Settlements 2 that it hasn't started correctly, it is probably because you didn't wait here- restart with a new game and wait until the messages have finished displaying.

In Game Setup
1) Mod Configuration Menu - Animated Ingestibles - Turn on to close pipboy, play when mouth covered in 1st person, and play animations during combat
2) Mod Configuration Menu - Survival Configuration Menu - turn ON savegame -> timed save
2) Backpacks of the Commonwealth - When you exit vault 111, this will inject backpacks into the levelled lists. Select your chosen distribution when it comes up. I like backpacks being completely unique, but whatever you want.
3) Utility Belt- equip the utility belt.

Optional, but Recommended
1) Download and install the Strigidae, Brotherhood Recon Expeditionary Suit, and Break Action Laser skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee.

Known Issues
-Settlers recruited via dialog do not benefit from Lunar Fallout Overhaul's settler changes- this is intended, as vanilla recruitable settlers (e.g. Sheffield) also don't benefit.
-Selecting "This is only a dream" when starting a new game is currently untested, and some of the mods that require start up routines to run may not start correctly.
-Cait is missing her shotgun after being recruited. This is a bug with Combat Zone Restored, after recruiting her run the following console command
00079305.additem 0005df30 1
-SimSettlements has quest dialog that references having a son that is still available if you select a non-vault start in StartMeUp

Mods in Testing: These probably work, but I haven't tested them yet, and therefore they are not included in the main modlist yet, feel free to add them and let me know if they work
-Bettery Skylines Flight, Nuka World Plus, Better Boston Airport, Father Companion, Sim Settlements 2 expansion packs

Notable Missing Mods
-CBBE- I find barbie doll proportions unimmersive. Women don't look look like that in real life.
-Thuggysmurf (Depravity, Outcasts and Remnants, etc)- The quality of the work on these mods is incredible, but they are massively let down by the writing and choice to include adolecent jokes. I personally find a lot of it cringeworthy and unimmersive. A mod that adds a dildo as a weapon and has a bunch of female NPCs in skimpy sexy corsets isn't one I personally want in my load order.
