# LunarFalloutPlus
Wabbajack Modlist for Fallout 4, for a moderate difficulty survival playthrough based on Lunar Fallout Overhaul, with a little extra spice.
Requires wabbajack - https://www.wabbajack.org/#/

Key Mods - Lunar Fallout Plus, Sim Settlements 2, Lore Based Power Armor Overhaul, Creative Perks, Unique Creatures and Monsters, Gunmetal Weapon,  Armor, and Clothing Skins.

Things you should know...
1) The game is balanced for a Survival playthrough that feels more like Normal or Hard, using a controller (rather than mouse and keyboard).
2) The balance of Lunar Fallout expects you to take at least one of the weapon damage perks.
3) Raider power armor drains Fusion Cores slower than the T45, and fusion cores are harder to find.
4) Start the Sim Settlements 2 quest line by building a recruitment beacon, if you're doing minutemen radiant quests you will probably be prompted to do so eventually..
5) The modlist includes a full repack of the vanilla texture BSAs for better performance, based on PhyOP light and the BiRaitBiTec texture packs, if you want to save a little space you can replace the BSAs in the data folder with them.
6) The modlist is designed for reliatively modern, middle range hardware. A high end graphics card is not required, but a decent processor is a must for running heavily modded Fallout 4.

Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
1) Move the Fame Files Folder into your game directory, to complete installation of F4SE and ENB
2) HighFPSFix.ini - adjust vsync and FPS cap to your desired settings, based on your monitor framerate, and whether you need vsync (if you don't have a g-sync or free-sync compatible monitor and graphics card, you need v-sync)
3) Disable PaintTheCommonwealth if you do not have the required creation club skins, disable CC-FoundOnly.esp if you have the skins, and want to be able to craft them.

When making a new game, after initial character creation a number of installation messages will display. DO NOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL THESE HAVE FINISHED. The FO4 script engine is fragile, and needs a minute to run through all the startup. If you get a message from Sim Settlements 2 that it hasn't started correctly, it is probably because you didn't wait here- restart with a new game and wait until the messages have finished displaying.

In Game Setup and MCM
1) Backpacks of the Commonwealth - Select your chosen distribution when it comes up. I like backpacks being completely unique, but whatever you want.
2) Companion heal thyself - I recommend setting the stun to 95%, the reduced stimpack distribution makes it difficult to keep a companion up if you have to constantly stim them.
3) Animated Ingestibles - Turn on to close pipboy, play when mouth covered in 1st person, and play animations during combat
4) Utility Belt- equip the utility belt.

Optional, but Recommended
1) Download and install the Strigidae, Brotherhood Recon and Break Action Laser skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee.

Known Issues
-Mod added settlers do not benefit from Lunar Fallout Overhaul's settler changes.
