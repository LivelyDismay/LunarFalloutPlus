# LunarFalloutPlus
Wabbajack Modlist for Fallout 4, for a moderate difficulty survival playthrough.

Key Mods - Lunar Fallout Plus, Sim Settlements 2, Unique Creatures and Monsters, plus clothing and armor mods, improved location, and plenty of immersion.

The game is balanced for a Survival playthrough that feels more like Normal or Hard, using a controller (rather than mouse and keyboard). If you want a harder experience, open up LunarPlus-LessDeadlySurvival.esp in FO4edit, and increase the incoming damage value. If you're a sadist, install the Pack Attack NPC edition mod, and you will die, a lot.

Things you should know...
1) You should take either Gunslinger or Rifleman perk, they're basically skills, and game balance kind of depends on you having one or the other.
2) Raider power armor drains Fusion Cores slower than the T45, and fusion cores are harder to find.

Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
1) HighFPSFix.ini - adjust vsync and FPS cap to your desired settings, based on your monitor framerate, and whether you need vsync
1) If you want, you can move the texture repacks into your game data folder, replacing the vanilla ones. It will reduce the space required by around 10 gigs, but won't make a difference for performance.
2) Backpacks of the Commonwealth - Select your chosen distribution when it comes up. I like backpacks being completely unique, but whatever you want.
3) Companion heal thyself - I recommend setting the stun to 95%, the reduced stimpack distribution makes it difficult to keep a companion up if you have to constantly stim them.
4) Utility Belt- equip the utility belt.

Optional, but Recommended
1) Download the Strigidae and Break Action Laser skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee.
